# chat app page
 
this is my first project that i uploaded to github so the project is chat app that work on browser using rooms (even though i assgned them with programming language) so use after downloading the dipendencies run it on port 3064 


the project thought me and focus on mainly about web sockets because the sockets make the chat at real time with out refreshing it also thought me abou extaracting urls using objects instead effectively instead of string for decreasing bug ...
